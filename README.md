# HOW TO PLAY:

Rhythm Cowboy is based off a game called "Shotgun" (everyone I knew called it "Cowboy" growing up).
Shotgun works a lot like rock-paper-scissors in that you make your move at the same time where your moves are:

1. Shoot: If your opponent is reloading at the same time you shoot, they die. After you shoot once, you run out of ammo and have to reload.

2. Reload: Get your ammo back, but leave yourself vulnerable for the turn.

3. Block: Pretty self explanatory. If you get shot while blocking, nothing happens.

If two people shoot at once, the game continues (at least that's how I always played it, [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Shotgun-Game) describes the rules with other weapons and stuff that change this outcome).

Rhythm Cowboy shakes things up in a couple of ways:

1. Movement. Instead of always facing each other, you are in a 2D plane and get the ability to dodge or reposition behind cover, making it safer to reload.

2. Rhythm. By timing your action just before the red marker, you can send another action on the next beat. You can combo this endlessly to overwhelm and out-skill your opponent.

If people think this is fun, I might eventually get around to adding more maps and special abilities, but for now this is it. Controls will be displayed in the lower corners when the game starts.
